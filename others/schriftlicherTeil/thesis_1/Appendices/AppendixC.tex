\chapter{Source Code} 
\label{AppendixC} 

All outputs of this thesis are stored in the GitHub \url{https://github.com/LasFo/ma-the}.

The structure is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \code{tests} contains the tests that were developed during the thesis. Most of thes test were
                    used to test for specific bug during the development process. Thus some of these
                    test seem unnecessary. The subdirectory contains
                    tests that run indefinitely. 
 \item \code{implementation} contains the implementations STMWSL, STMLA and the Project implementation.
                             It does not contain the GHC implementation. Since it is no longer part of 
                             the standart libraries of GHC 8.0.1, it can be downloaded with \code{cabal}\footnote{\url{https://www.haskell.org/cabal/}}
 \item \code{recavoid} contains ideas and challenges for the problem of unnecessary recomputations.
 \item \code{stm} contains all code that were developed during the the first part of this thesis that is described in Appendix \ref{AppendixA}.
 \item \code{timing} contains the ressources that were used for the performance tests.
 \item \code{others} contains a documentation, this written part and slides for a talk.
\end{itemize}
