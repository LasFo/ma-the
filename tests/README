To test all terminating test load terminatingTests.hs with 
an implementation of STM you want to test.

All tests import a library called STM. To load another STM 
library you either have to rename that library or 
change the import in the source code of each test. 

Each test prints its desired output before executing.
USe this output to figure out if the tests work.
