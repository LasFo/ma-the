How about boxing the value in the form Hood does it. This means everytime the evaluation of
an expression is demanded, the value is transformed into a critical value. To box these 
values in a matter that they enter a retryMVar by them self as soon as their evaluation
is demanded, is possible (see Hood). The problem is that unboxing these values is not
(easily) possible. The boxing can be done with unsafePerformIO, but this wrapper cannot
be removed, since it does not exist from the view of Haskell.
