    Useless because readSet < writeSet
      iterating over all TVars twice
      double validation
      bugged because readSet is not validated (and empty in my test)
         validation of the readSet would lead to a deadlock because
         the readSet may contain TVar in the writeSet of another
         transaction and vice versa

Conclusion
  Think about an imporovement
