Introduction
  why is STM cool in Haskell and in other languages not that cool
    Strong vs Weak Isolation

  conventions such as t1,t2 are tvars and a,b are values

Implementation
  example for every interface action
  notes on implementation
    ordered locking
    locking prevents reads(another structure than MVar would 
                           allow further optimizations)

Evaluation
  Results
    Scaling
 
  Observations
    No memory leaks observed

Future Work
  globalCount overflow
  STMWSL btter if alternative to MVar is used

Definitions 
  conflict
  critical
