test again with STMWSL2 since it is now different from STMWSL1
test again after altering STM that garbage is filled in readTVar
                          touchedTVars is no longer part of the state
                          remove stmAction from local definitions 
                          retry locks TVars in readSet not in touchedTVars
                          forced evaluation of res no longer needed
